C# is a programming language

.NET is a term that tends to cover both the .NET Framework (an application framework library) and the Common Language Runtime, which is the runtime in which .NET assemblies are run.

Microsoft's implementation of C# is heavily integrated with the .NET Framework, which is the reason why the two concepts are confused.
